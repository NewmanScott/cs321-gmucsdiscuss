Simple Flask backend interacting with SQLite DB.

## Running backend server
Make sure you're in the backend directory

If you're running the server for the first time, run the following commands:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
```

```
source .venv/bin/activate
flask run
```

Visit the address shown after running `flask run` to see the server respond :)
